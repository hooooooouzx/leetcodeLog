## Hint
Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`  
**Output:** `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`  
**Explanation:**
- rotate 1 step to the right: `[7,1,2,3,4,5,6]`
- rotate 2 steps to the right: `[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]`
- rotate 3 steps to the right: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2`  
**Output:** `[3,99,-1,-100]`  
**Explanation:**
- rotate 1 step to the right: `[99,-1,-100,3]`
- rotate 2 steps to the right: `[3,99,-1,-100]`

## Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

## Follow up:
Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
