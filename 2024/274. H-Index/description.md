### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `citations = [3,0,6,1,5]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `citations = [1,3,1]`  
**Output:** `1`  

### Constraints
- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
